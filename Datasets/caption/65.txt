A line chart about the production of Canola in Canada in the year 2020 . Canola production did not prove to be very fruitful for the early half of the year . However we were able to see a huge surge in Canola production in September , jumping up to over 3 tonnes in the month . However this level was short-lived and fell back to an average of 2 tonnes by the end of the year .
