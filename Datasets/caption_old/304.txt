This chart shows the production of fresh fruit, by the farm product price index, in Canada in 2017. We see a generally increasing pattern throughout the year. We start at a markedly low level of production from January until May, at which point production starts to increase until July. Production then falls for August to October, until surging in November and reaching a maximum in December.
