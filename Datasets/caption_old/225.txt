The line chart shows the farm product price index (FPPI) about production of grain in Canada during 2016. It's possible to see how the index has been quite steady from January to June, but then a relevant drop has been recorded from June to August, where the index dropped from 1100 to 980. During the last few months of the year the index slowly started to increase again.
