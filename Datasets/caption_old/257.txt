The graph illustrates the total number of vehicles from the United States entering Canada. Data for every month of 2016 is shown. The numbers vary for each month. A high is reached in July (about 1300000 vehicles), probably because of people going on vacation. Low values can be found for the winter months, e.g., less than 700000 vehicles in January and February and roughly 700000 vehicles in November and December.
