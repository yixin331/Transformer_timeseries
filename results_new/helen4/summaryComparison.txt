Supply increases during February , remains almost unchanged throughout March and sharply increases during the following months until it reaches its peak in July with 29000 tonnes .
gold_template: This graph represents the Canadian templateTitle[0] of templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ( in templateYLabel[0] ) during templateTitleDate[0] . The lowest value can be observed in templateXValue[0] with 21000 templateYLabel[0] . templateTitle[0] increases during templateXValue[1] , remains almost unchanged throughout templateXValue[2] and sharply increases during the following months until it reaches its peak in templateXValue[6] with 29000 templateYLabel[0] .

generated_template: The graph shows the templateTitle[0] of templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] in templateYLabel[0] in templateTitleSubject[0] during templateTitleDate[0] . The values are steady for the first three months and peak in templateXValue[3] . The templateTitle[0] amount generally declines after templateXValue[3] except for a significant surge in templateXValue[9] and a slight templatePositiveTrend in templateXValue[last] .
generated: The graph shows the Supply of creamery butter Canada in Tonnes Canada during 2016 .  The values are steady for the first three months and peak in April .  The Supply amount generally declines after April except for a significant surge in October and a slight increase in December .

gold: The graph highlights the production of fresh vegetables over the course of a year . It follow a `` U '' shape with a local increase in the month of June .
gold_template: The graph highlights the templateTitle[0] of templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] over the course of a year . It follow a `` U '' shape with a local templatePositiveTrend in the templateXLabel[0] of templateXValue[5] .

generated_template: The graph shows the templateTitle[0] of templateTitle[1] in templateTitle[2] in templateTitleSubject[0] in the year of templateTitleDate[0] . As the graph rises from templateXValue[0] to templateXValue[1] , it drops sharply until templateXValue[6] , before reaching a minimum of templateYValue[5] . Subsequently , the value rises continuously until the end of the year , reaching a maximum of templateYValue[9] in templateXValue[last] .
